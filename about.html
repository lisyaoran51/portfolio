        <p class="about-lead">
          I have almost seven years of software engineering experience, with the past four years focused on backend development.
          Go is my main language, and I currently serve as a backend lead in a fintech company.
          I led a Visa debit card project for two years, building the backend from zero to one and later owning the core transaction domain.

        My journey spans fintech backend systems and hardware startup execution.
        In both contexts, I drove cross-functional alignment and delivered complete products from concept to launch.
        These two zero-to-one experiences shaped my ability to adapt and execute under high uncertainty.

          <p class="timeline-text">
            I designed and implemented the backend architecture from scratch. After the team expanded, I focused on the core transaction logic,
            while also handling onboarding, code reviews, development standards, and cross-functional coordination with merchants, PM, finance,
            and operations teams. To satisfy strict Visa transaction timing requirements, we currently run on a single-node architecture.
            Before this phase, I also had two years of microservices development experience.

            Before moving fully into backend development, I led a startup project to build a Bluetooth gaming device.
            I coordinated design, mechanical, electronics, firmware, software, and manufacturer collaboration,
            and personally took ownership of firmware development in a highly complex environment.

          <h4>Looking for Greater Growth and Scale</h4>
          <p>
            My current system has become stable after two years. Most daily work now centers on repetitive business logic,
            and traffic scale is limited. I am looking for a more challenging environment where I can keep growing through
            higher scale, deeper architecture challenges, and broader product impact.
